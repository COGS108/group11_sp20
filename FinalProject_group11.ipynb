    "All of our datasets have been provided by publicly available sources such as data.world, The Bureau of Labor Statistics, or other US Government agencies. Since these data are being provided to the public, we anticipate no restrictions in using it for the purpose of this project. Additionally, no restrictions have been posted for the datasets we are accessing. Much of the data we are using is provided by state or federal governments, which is required by law to provide strong protection for the data that are available to the public. For the data sources that are not guaranteed to do this, we will provide privacy by anonymizing any potentially personal identifiable information. However, we do not anticipate this being an issue, as all the data collected are aggregates that don’t include any potentially personal identifiable information. Occupations with less than 1,000 employees in a certain state were removed from our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of our dataset sources, data.world, consists of contributors of various backgrounds and experience levels. This increases the potential for bias, since there is no way of confirming whether the presentation of the data is biased towards fulfilling the contributor’s needs. The user has the option of viewing the contributor’s Kaggle profile and their LinkedIn profiles, but the amount of information that is provided to the user is controlled by the contributor themselves. If we utilize the provided information to confirm the legitimacy of the contributor’s data, we can decrease the chance of potential bias. For our other data source, data.gov, there is a smaller potential of bias given the fact that it is a government source. While we cannot assume that government sources are entirely free of bias, we can assume that it is more of a fair source than non-government sources. Government sources are supposed to be free of affiliation to political parties, which is why we can assume that the data presented has relatively low levels of bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "A potential ethical concern we have considered is data misinformation/misinterpretation. If an individual comes across our analysis without the understanding that this data relies partly on probability instead of concrete metrics, and that this analysis was not conducted by professional Data Scientists, it might lead to the unnecessary spread of fear that one might lose their job to automation, or further contribute to data misinterpretation."
